# NicheDE
This folder contains the code to reproduce the kidney data analysis in figure 6. "Integrated_kidney_analysis" is the code to perform niche-DE and "kidney_downstream_analysis" is the code to reproduce the pathway enrichment and ligand-receptor analyses. For simplicity, the niche-DE objects are provided in this folder rather than the raw data. If you would like the raw data (which for the counts and coordinates is available in the niche-DE object), please email kaishu@wharton.upenn.edu.
