# NicheDE
This folder contains the code to reproduce the integrated data analysis in figures 4 and 5. For simplicity, the niche-DE objects are provided in this folder rather than the raw data. If you would like the raw data (which for the counts and coordinates is available in the niche-DE object), please email kaishu@wharton.upenn.edu.
